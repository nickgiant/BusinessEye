# BusinessEye
Application in Java Swing and MySQL about issuing invoices for service companies.
The application domain is separated from the rest of the code.
This is convenient in cases of business database software where modules have patterns and can be implemented fast even if they are complex. 
Currently captions, menus, and messages are only in Greek.
