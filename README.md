Multi module application in Java Swing and MySQL.
Currently three separate modules are implemented.

1. Issuing of *invoices* for service companies. Stores data for customers, invoices and more. Moreover informative reports and printing of invoices.
2. Basic functions of *single-entry accounting* system. Stores data for accounts, traders and records about transactions. Tax data is collected from transactions as well as MYF (as they called) information.
3. Calculation of *return VAT* of farmers. Stores data about farmers and their sales for the given fiscal period. Also reports of their application form to the local public revenue office can be printed.

The application is designed to follow Greek regulations.
As a consequence captions, menus, and messages are in Greek.
